The Origins and Formation of Niagara Falls
Around 12,000 years ago, during the last Ice Age, the retreat of glaciers carved out the Great Lakes and the Niagara River. As the glaciers melted, massive volumes of water began to flow from Lake Erie to Lake Ontario, and the rushing water gradually wore down rock formations, creating the waterfalls we see today. Niagara Falls has been naturally eroding over thousands of years, slowly moving upriver.
